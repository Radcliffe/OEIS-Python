# OEIS sequence: A180875

 # An alternative version of the sequence starts (for n >= 0):
# 0, 1, 3, 11, ..., or in terms of the approximation: [(1/2)*Pi, 1+(1/2)*Pi,
# 3+Pi, 11+(7/2)*Pi, ...]. Similar to the formula of _Detlef Meya_ above, the
# sequence then can be computed (without a special initial case) as:
from functools import cache
from math import comb as binomial
@cache
def a(n): return n + sum((binomial(n, j) - 1) * a(n - j) for j in range(1, n))
print([a(n) for n in range(23)])  # _Peter Luschny_, Jun 09 2023
