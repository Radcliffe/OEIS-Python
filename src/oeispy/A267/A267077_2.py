# OEIS sequence: A267077

#!/usr/bin/python3
# This sequence is easy if you use a Pell-equation solver such as labmath.py
# Solve the A267077 Pell equation:
# nx^2 - (4n+4)y^2 = 5n-4; but also y^2 == 1 mod n^2
# Let u = nx, then # u^2 - n*(4n+4)y^2 = n*(5n-4)
#   and (y > n) and (u == 0 mod n) and (y^2 == 1 mod n^2)
# (y > n makes m > 0)
# Report m = (y^2 - 1) / n^2
import labmath
print(0, 1)
print(1, 35) # When n<2, the Pell equation is elliptical.
for nn in range(2,1001):
